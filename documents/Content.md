# Bayes-Statistik, WS2021/2022
## Contribution to open-source is fun! 

by Denise Welsch

# Content 
-	Welcome
-	Statsomat https://statsomat.com 
    -	Minimal but sufficient GUI user-interaction 
    -	Automatic reporting (automated tables and graphics) 
    -	Human-readable interpretation 
    -	Downloadable learner-code to reproduce the results 
    -	Help for learners all over the world 

-	Goal: The goal of this course is to develop an app for a statistical application treated by Bayes-theory and satisfying the Statsomat philosophy. We will start with a "starting code" which we will extend and develop. The statistical application is the relationship of two proportions (difference, ratio, efficacy) by using one-two models: 
    -  Analytically (priors given by Beta distributions)
    -  MCMC simulation (priors given by Beta distributions)

-	GitHub und GitHuB Desktop, our repository and the subdirectories 

-	Evaluation of your contributions (comments, commits, additions, deletions, reviews/tests):
    - To get "satisfactory" you need to show: >= 25 meaningful comments, >= 25 code line additions, >= 1 commit, >=1 review help, >=0 deletions.  

-	Installation: Download and Install GitHub Desktop, clone the reyar/BayesTwoProp repository, install R, RStudio, tinytex (https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/install-latex.html) and all the required packages demanded by the R scripts. Alternatively: Work on RCloud. 

- Start with Issues 1,2,3. These are introductory issues. 

- Rules for next issues
    - Each student should work on at least one issue   
    - Pick up a next open issue and create a new branch to make your changes and to add your lines. Give the branch a short name representing the issue and your name 
    - Commit significant changes to the branch and push them to the cloud
    - Open a pull request to add significant commits to the master
    - You can create branches to work also on the issues of your collegues and to give them hints (comments)

# Further Comments
-	Please use the `data.table` package for EDA (extract, transform, load) data. Use the package `dplyr` only if really needed.
-	Debugging: Discuss the errors in our group. Google the errors. Check solutions on StackOverflow or on the official GitHub pages of the R packages. 
-	Programming best practices:
    - Use human-readable object names (e.g. do not name objects with `x` or `y`) 
    - Write short lines (break the lines if they are too long)
    - Comment properly the lines for newcomers 
    - Use blank lines between blocks of code representing distinct ideas
    - Do not use libraries which do not have a large community  
-   Should you have new ideas, you are welcomed to open an issue (also for very small changes)
