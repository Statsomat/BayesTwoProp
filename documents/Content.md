# Further Comments
*	Please use the `data.table` package for EDA (extract, transform, load) data. Use the package `dplyr` only if really needed.
*	Debugging: Discuss the errors in our group. Google the errors. Check solutions on StackOverflow or on the official GitHub pages of the R packages. 
*	Prerequisites: Course of Prof. Neuhäuser, minimal R programming
