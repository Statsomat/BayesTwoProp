# Main Terms for Using GitHub Desktop

## 1. Repository reyar/BayesTwoProp

## 2. Clone

## 3. Commit

## 4. Push
Sending your committed changes to a repository on a remote service like GitHub.

## 5. Pull
Fetching changes from a repository on a remote service (like GitHub) and merging them into your local repository.

## 6. Branch
A parallel version of a repository. It allows you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.

## 7. Merge
Taking the changes from one branch and applying them into another (often the main branch).

## 8. Pull Request (PR)
A method of submitting contributions to a project. It's a request to merge changes from one branch into another. The changes are "pulled". 

## 9. Fetch
Downloading changes from a repository on a remote service (like GitHub) without merging them into your local repository.

## 10. Status
The current state of your repository, showing which files are modified, staged, or untracked.

## 11. Stage/Unstage
Preparing a file for commit (staging) or removing it from the next commit (unstaging).

## 12. Remote
A version of your project that is hosted on a service like GitHub. It's the online counterpart to your local repository.

## 13. Local
The version of your project that is on your computer.

## 14. .gitignore
A file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project.

## 15. Diff
The differences between two commits, or between the staging area and the repository.

## 16. History
A list of all commits in a repository.

## 17. Sync
A combination of pulling changes from and pushing changes to a repository on a remote service like GitHub.

## 18. Revert
Undoing a commit by creating a new commit with contrary changes.

## 19. Stash
Temporarily shelving changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later.

## 20. Origin
The default name Git gives to the remote repository where you cloned from. In GitHub Desktop, this typically refers to your repository on GitHub.
