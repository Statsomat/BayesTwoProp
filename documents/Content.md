# Bayes-Statistik, WS2021/2022
by Dr. Denise Welsch

# Content 
-	Welcome
-	Statsomat https://statsomat.com 
    -	Minimal but sufficient GUI user-interaction 
    -	Automatic reporting (automated tables and graphics) 
    -	Human-readable interpretation 
    -	Downloadable and reproducible code 

-	Goal: The goal of this course is to develop an app for a statistical application treated by Bayes-related solutions and satisfying the Statsomat philosophy 

-	GitHub und GitHuB Desktop

-	Evaluation by statistics of contributions (commits, additions, deletions, comments, pull requests)  

-	Installation: Download and Install GitHub Desktop, clone GitHub repository. 

- Start with Issue 1.

- Pick up issues, work on them and resolve them.

# Further Comments
-	Please use the `data.table` package for EDA (extract, transform, load) data. Use the package `dplyr` only if really needed.
-	Debugging: Discuss the errors in our group. Google the errors. Check solutions on StackOverflow or on the official GitHub pages of the R packages. 
-	Programming best practices:
    - Use human-readable object names (e.g. do not name objects with `x` or `y`) 
    - Write short lines (break the lines if they are too long)
    - Comment properly the lines for newcomers 
    - Use blank lines between blocks of code representing distinct ideas
    - Do not use libraries which do not have a large community  
-	Prerequisites: Course of Prof. Neuhäuser, minimal R programming
