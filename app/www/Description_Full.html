  <h3>Description</h3>
</div>

<p>
This application is designed to help users analyze the relationship between an exposure and an outcome using Bayesian statistical methods.  
By uploading a dataset and defining key parameters, users can calculate and interpret measures of association between the exposure of interest and the outcome.  
The application simplifies the process of Bayesian analysis, making it accessible even for users without extensive statistical expertise.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Data Input and Processing:</strong><br>
Users upload a CSV file containing their data. The file must include at least one column for the exposure variable (e.g., vaccine status) and one for the outcome variable (e.g., presence of a disease).  
The app provides a straightforward interface to select the relevant variables and specify labels for exposure and outcome presence.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Bayesian Prior Distributions:</strong><br>
The app uses Beta distributions to model prior beliefs about the probabilities of the outcome in the exposed and control groups.  
Users input parameters (a1, b1, a2, b2) to reflect their prior knowledge or assumptions. These priors can influence the final estimates, allowing for robust inference when the sample size is small or incomplete.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Calculation of Posterior Distributions:</strong><br>
Based on the uploaded data and prior distributions, the app calculates posterior distributions for the probabilities of the outcome in the exposed and control groups.  
This posterior estimation combines prior beliefs with observed data to provide updated probabilities.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Statistical Comparisons:</strong><br>
The app offers three functions for comparing probabilities between the exposed and control groups:<br>
- Difference (θ₁ - θ₂): Measures the absolute difference in probabilities.<br>
- Risk Ratio (θ₁ / θ₂): Calculates the relative risk associated with the exposure.<br>
- Relative Risk Reduction (1 - θ₁ / θ₂): Shows the proportion by which the exposure reduces or increases the risk compared to the control group.
